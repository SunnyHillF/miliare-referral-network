A website that has a landing page that is nothing more than a login screen.

If they already have an account, they will have the ability to login and be directed to a website to track their pending payouts and business referred to each strategic partner.

If they do not have an account, there should be a "Register" button that redirects them to a registration page.
On the registration page we need to collect simple information to register their account, including name, email address, physical address, phone number ext.
There should also be a dropdown to choose what company they are affiliated with - since we are going to allow multiple companies to refer through this.
If they select WFG, there should be an option to enter the name of their direct upline EVC
Following that there should be a question asking for the name of their direct upline SMD
Once they have filled out the basic information, they should be navigated to a docusign to submit a 1099-NEC form so that we can issue 1099's at the end of the year
Lastly, they should be navigated to another docusign "or maybe we put both on one" that is a direct deposit form to collect their banking information

Once they have access to the website, I would like to have a clean way to show 3 sections in the website:

Section 1: Your Business: This tab will show what they have referred, how much they have earned in total, and how much pending commissions they have for the next monthly cycle.

Section 2: Learn: This page should have a list of each of our strategic partners with the option to click on each one and learn more about what their services are and links to any trainings we have on each partner.

Section 3: Refer: This page should have all of our strategic partners on it. When they click on the strategic partner it should navigate them to whatever widget they are using to collect leads and referrals from our agents.

We need a way to easily refer our clients to each company, track what has been referred by each person, collect data back from each company as to how much each individual person has earned, generate a payment report monthly for how much needs to be sent to each person per month, and generate a 1099 for each person enrolled in the company every year. We also need it to track upline SMDs, and EVCs of each agent. For example, If an SMD has an 10 agents that referred business to our strategic partners that month, there will be a certain amount allocated to a pool of money to pay out in bonuses to the leaders that have the most production coming in from their team.

Here is a list of the strategic partners we currently have enrolling into this program:
