# proto-mrn

## Overview
This is a reference implementation for the Miliare application. It contains prototype code that will be used as a foundation for building the main application in the parent repository.

## Purpose
This codebase provides a clean starting point with established patterns and configurations that will be expanded upon in the full application development. It serves as a technical reference for developers working on the main project.

## Usage
1. Clone or copy this directory to use as a starting point
2. Install dependencies using `npm install` or `pnpm install`
3. Follow the development instructions in the parent repository

## Notes
- This reference implementation has been stripped of all version control metadata to serve as clean starter code
- The `.appignore` file contains recommended ignore patterns for development
