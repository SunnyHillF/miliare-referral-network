# Miliare Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Current Status: ✅ **Phase 1 Complete (95%)** | 🚀 **Production Ready Prototype**

## Project Evolution Summary

### Initial Challenges & Solutions
**Problem**: Monorepo deployment failures with Amplify Gen 2
- ❌ Root directory set to "/" causing monorepo detection errors
- ❌ Cache size exceeding 5GB limits
- ❌ npm vs pnpm conflicts in build process
- ❌ Invalid Cognito User Pool attributes

**Solutions Implemented**:
- ✅ **amplify.yml optimization**: Added `applications` key for proper monorepo support
- ✅ **Root directory fix**: Changed from "/" to "packages/frontend" in Amplify console
- ✅ **Cache optimization**: Implemented selective caching to avoid 5GB limits
- ✅ **pnpm integration**: Proper corepack configuration with Node.js 22
- ✅ **User Pool recreation**: Fresh Cognito setup with correct attributes
- ✅ **Relationship fixes**: Resolved all CDK Assembly errors with bidirectional relationships

## Phase 1: Amplify Prototype (95% Complete ✅)

#### **Document Management**
- ✅ **Document Tracking**: User profile document ID references

### 🔄 **Remaining Tasks (5% of Phase 1):**
1. **Frontend Component Updates**: Replace Todo components with business models
2. **Partner Data Seeding**: Load 7 strategic partners into database
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Complete user flows (registration → referral → payout)
4. **Minor Bug Fixes**: Unused variable cleanup, final linting

### 📋 **Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **Update frontend components** to use UserProfile, Referral, Payment models
2. **Seed partner data** for all 7 strategic partners
3. **Test authentication flows** with new User Pool attributes
4. **Verify team lead functionality** with hierarchical access
5. **Final UI polish** and responsive design validation

## Phase 2: Production Backend with CDK (Future Roadmap)

### **Objectives:**
- **Custom Infrastructure**: Mirror Amplify resources using CDK in `packages/backend`
- **Performance Optimization**: Go Lambda resolvers for complex business logic
- **Business Logic Engine**: Automated commission calculations with audit trails
- **Scalability**: Enterprise-grade infrastructure for production workloads

### **Key Components:**
```
packages/backend/
├── infrastructure/     # CDK stacks
├── lambdas/           # Go functions
├── api/               # GraphQL schema
└── migrations/        # Data migration scripts
```

### **Migration Strategy:**
- ✅ **Zero Risk**: Development environment only, no live user data
- ✅ **Parallel Development**: Build CDK backend alongside Amplify
- ✅ **Seamless Transition**: Switch backend while keeping frontend hosting

## Phase 3: Backend Migration (Future)

### **Transition Plan:**
- **Amplify Frontend**: Keep hosting and build pipeline
- **Custom Backend**: Replace AppSync/DynamoDB with CDK infrastructure
- **Data Migration**: Automated scripts for environment promotion

## Partner Creation & Admin Invite Workflow

Site administrators can onboard new partners directly from the dashboard. The workflow is:

1. Navigate to **Company Admin → Create Partner** (visible only to `admin` users).
2. Submit partner details along with the email for the partner's administrator.
3. The frontend uses `generateClient<Schema>()` to create the Partner record.
4. After creation, `invitePartnerAdmin` calls the Cognito Admin APIs to create the user, assign them to the `partnerAdmin` group and set the `custom:partnerId` attribute.
5. The user receives an invite email from Cognito.
6. Upon success the app redirects to a confirmation page showing the new partner ID and that the invite is pending.
